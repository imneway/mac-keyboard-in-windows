# Simulate Mac keyboard in Windows

This Autohotkey script simulate Mac keyboard and some system shortcuts in Windows.

## Installation

1. Install [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com).
2. Run the `mac-keyboard.ahk`. *
3. Put the mac-keyboard.ahk in the [Startup folder](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/startup-folder-in-windows-8) so it will auto run on startup.

## Notes

* If you are using a Magic Keyboard, use `mac-keyboard(magic-keyboard).ahk` instead.
* If you are using a customizable keyboard like Logitech MX Keys, you'd better use [SharpKeys](https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys) to remap Ctrl, Alt and Win keys. In this case, please use `mac-keyboard(sharpkeys).ahk` instead.
